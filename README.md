# Whack Attack: The Ultimate Mole Smashing Challenge!

In **Whack Attack**, your mission is simple: **whack as many moles as you can** before time runs out! But beware, these moles get quicker and trickier with every difficulty level you choose! Whether youâ€™re a beginner or a seasoned mole whacker, thereâ€™s a challenge here for everyone.

## Game Modes:
You get to pick your level of challenge from the start:

## Special Features:
- **Golden Moles**: Keep an eye out for the rare **golden moles**! Whacking them will give you extra points and a score boost!
